Mbuch Fantasy is a football analytics web application built using Python,Pandas, and Streamlit that predicts team efficiency based on comprehensive player performance metrics. The system utilizes a dataset of 1,573 players from major European leagues, incorporating advanced statistics including expected goals (xG), expected assists (xAG), progressive play metrics (carries, passes, receptions), disciplinary records, and playing time data. We engineered a position-specific rating algorithm that weights different performance indicators based on positional roles - attackers are evaluated primarily on goal contributions (60%) and progressive play (25%), midfielders on progressive actions (40%) and versatility, while defenders are assessed on reliability through minutes played (50%) and disciplinary record (30%). Each player receives a 0-100 rating that reflects their real-world impact and consistency.
The application features an intuitive interface where users select tactical formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-2-3-1) and populate their starting XI using searchable dropdown menus with autocomplete functionality. Upon team completion, the system calculates an overall efficiency score by averaging individual player ratings, providing contextual feedback ranging from "Elite Team - Championship material" to "Relegation battle" scenarios. The underlying methodology combines data preprocessing, feature engineering for position-specific metrics, and rule-based scoring rather than traditional machine learning models, making it both interpretable and computationally efficient. The app successfully bridges advanced football analytics with user-friendly interaction, allowing users to test tactical hypotheses and player combinations while receiving quantitative feedback based on actual performance data.
