Mbuch Fantasy is a football analytics web application built using Python,Pandas, and Streamlit that predicts team efficiency based on comprehensive player performance metrics. The system utilizes a dataset of 1,573 players from major European leagues, incorporating advanced statistics including expected goals (xG), expected assists (xAG), progressive play metrics (carries, passes, receptions), disciplinary records, and playing time data. We engineered a position-specific rating algorithm that weights different performance indicators based on positional roles - attackers are evaluated primarily on goal contributions (60%) and progressive play (25%), midfielders on progressive actions (40%) and versatility, while defenders are assessed on reliability through minutes played (50%) and disciplinary record (30%). Each player receives a 0-100 rating that reflects their real-world impact and consistency.
